\title{Extract a data subset with a specific cell population and their most variableg genes.}
\usage{
extract_data(
  population,
  expression.init,
  SeuratObject.init,
  records,
  params,
  figures
)
}
\arguments{
\item{population}{a character. It corresponds to the cell population that scEVE will attempt to cluster.}

\item{expression.init}{a scRNA-seq dataset of raw count expression, without selected genes.
Its rows are genes and its columns are cells.}

\item{SeuratObject.init}{a SeuratObject generated from expression.init, on which
the function RunUMAP() of Seurat has been applied already.}

\item{records}{a named list, with three data.frames: \code{cells}, \code{markers} and \code{meta}.}

\item{params}{a list of parameters (cf. \code{sceve::get_default_parameters()}).}

\item{figures}{a boolean that indicates if figures should be drawn to explain the clustering iteration.}
}
\value{
a named list, with three names: \code{expression}, \code{SeuratObject} and \code{ranking_of_genes}.
They correspond to the scRNA-seq expression matrix of a specific cell population,
as well as the SeuratObject and the ranking of genes generated from this matrix.
